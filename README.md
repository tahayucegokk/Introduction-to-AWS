## Introduction-to-AWS

## Notes:

# The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing
    • On-demand self service: Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service
    provider
    • Broad network access: Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
    • Multi-tenancy and resource pooling: Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
    • Rapid elasticity and scalability: Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed Quickly and easily scale based on demand
    • Measured service:  Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

    Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
    • Pay On-Demand: don’t own hardware
    • Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
    • Benefit from massive economies of scale
    • Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
    • Stop guessing capacity
    • Scale based on actual measured usage
    • Increase speed and agility
    • Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
    • Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure
