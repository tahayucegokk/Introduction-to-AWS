## Notes:

# The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing
    • On-demand self service: Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service
    provider
    • Broad network access: Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
    • Multi-tenancy and resource pooling: Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
    • Rapid elasticity and scalability: Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed Quickly and easily scale based on demand
    • Measured service:  Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

    • Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
         Pay On-Demand: don’t own hardware
         Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
    • Benefit from massive economies of scale
         Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
    • Stop guessing capacity
         Scale based on actual measured usage
    • Increase speed and agility
    • Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
    • Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

## Problems solved by the Cloud

    • Flexibility: change resource types when needed
    • Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
    • Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or
    adding additional nodes
    • Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
    • High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
    • Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

    • Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
         Provide building blocks for cloud IT
        Provides networking, computers, data storage space
        Highest level of flexibility
        Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
    • Platform as a Service (PaaS)
        Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
        Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
    • Software as a Service (SaaS)
        Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
